This is the Spring Boot starter displaying the Spring Boot Banner as HTML-ASCII-Art through a custom Thymeleaf-Tag, first shown at [Spring I/O 2016 (EN)](https://github.com/michael-simons/springio2016) and then at [W-JAX 2016 (DE)](https://github.com/michael-simons/W-JAX2016). 

The code has been adapted to Spring Boot 2.0+ and Thymeleaf 3.0+.
